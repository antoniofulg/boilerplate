# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Qualidade de Codigo**: confirm ESLint + Prettier enforcement, consistent folder plan, ADRs for major choices, and dependency approvals.
- **II. Tipagem entre Front e Back**: ensure shared schema/package updates land before implementation and every API call will import typed contracts + runtime validation.
- **III. Testes minimos**: declare the essential automated test, outline unit/integration coverage for critical logic, and schedule the manual smoke test + CI lint→test→build order.
- **IV. UX e Consistencia**: reference the mini design system components to touch, responsive breakpoints, feedback states, and analytics events for onboarding + main flow.
- **V. Performance e Confiabilidade**: document how the plan stays under the 250 KB initial bundle, keeps API p95 < 300 ms, applies code splitting/caching/CDN, and releases via staging → smoke → prod behind flags.
- **VI–VIII. Operacoes & Workflow**: prove CI/CD automation, security controls (HTTPS, hashing, validation, rate limit), and the feature checklist (types → backend → frontend → test → smoke → deploy → monitor).

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
